## Abstract

“Study with me” videos contain footage of people studying for hours, in which social components like conversations or informational content like instructions are absent. Recently, they became increasingly popular on video-sharing platforms. This paper provides the first broad look into what “study with me” videos are and how people use them. We analyzed 30 “study with me” videos and conducted 12 interviews with their viewers to understand their motivation and viewing practices. We identified a three-factor model that explains the mechanism for shaping a satisfactory studying experience in general. One of the factors, a well-suited ambience, was difficult to achieve because of two common challenges: external conditions that prevent studying in study-friendly places and extra cost needed to create a personally desired ambience. We found that the viewers used “study with me” videos to create a personalized ambience at a lower cost, to find controllable peer pressure, and to get emotional support. These findings suggest that the viewers self-regulate their learning through watching “study with me” videos to improve efficiency even when studying alone at home.

### What are the salient characteristics of SWM videos? 

We randomly selected and observed 30 pre-recorded and live SWM streams on YouTube. We used the YouTube API2 to download the metadata of the top 600 videos that have the “study with me” keyword in the title or description and randomly selected 50 archived videos among them. One author skimmed through each video to identify meaningful features and made a decision whether to include it in the analysis, and another author reviewed the result.

Out of the 50 videos, 20 videos were excluded from the further analysis. Of the excluded ones, twelve were vlog type videos that did not contain a live study session but showed a person studying in time lapse, eating, and getting ready. Another five were “How to Study” videos which share study tips or advice. The rest were either not available for watching or a lecture video.

We compared the final 30 SWM videos with other study-related videos found on YouTube and other virtual study platforms to identify the distinguishing characteristics of SWM videos. Our analysis revealed three salient characteristics across these SWM videos: (1) the creator studies on camera during their actual study session, (2) there is no direct instruction delivered from the video, and (3) there is a distinction between viewers and creators. These characteristics distinguish SWM videos from other study-related videos found on YouTube and other platforms such as Gooroomee and Virtual Study Room.

### What are the differences among SWM videos? 

To understand what categories of SWM videos exist, we annotated each video with salient production and social features. To select features that vary across SWM videos, we conducted iterative coding with inductive analysis: after one annotator coded, another annotator verified it. The identified features are as follows: the number of people in the video, whether front face was showing, whether chat rooms were available, whether a timer was shown, whether broadcast live, what kind of background sound was playing, whether the creator speaks, uploader’s occupation, and video length. As shown in Figure 2, only one person appears in 29 of the 30 videos. Chat activity occurs in 21 of the 30 videos, but the creator’s involvement is often confined to minimal interaction such as ‘hi’. In 10 videos, the creator verbally talks to the viewer. The front face of the creator is shown in 16 videos, while the timer appears on screen in 14 videos. Half the videos use music or autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), which is tingling sensation that comes from listening or watching videos. Our count of ASMR includes only cases where the creator has explicitly mentioned their use of ASMR in the video title or description. There are more pre-recorded videos than live videos. The creator’s occupation—when the information was available—included test-taker, student, and teacher. The video length ranged from 45 minutes to 24 hours, with an average duration of 5h 45m (standard deviation: 5.7 hours).

## Results

### Three Factors That Shape Satisfactory Studying Experience
We found that interview participants looked for two types of effects in common that lead to satisfactory study experience: (1) being focused on their task and (2) having an extended length of study time. We also found that these are influenced by the person’s internal state, whether they are distracted or motivated. Furthermore, we identified that people get distracted or motivated either (1) by themselves or (2) by external ambience that is formed by both the place and the people they are with. We now explain the individual components of the model and their interaction in more detail.

### Two Common Challenges in Creating Satisfying Study ambience
The first challenge happens when there are no study-friendly places available. As mentioned above, people often go to places where other people also study rather than studying alone. However, it is not possible to go to such places in some situations. P3 said “I like the ambience of study in the library the most, but I can’t go because using a laptop is forbidden due to noise. I have no choice when I have to use my laptop.” Because of COVID-19, many libraries and cafes closed down, and participants (P5, P6, P7, and P12) reported they couldn’t go to such places any more and had hard time focusing on their work because they had no options outside of their home.

Secondly, it requires extra cost to surround oneself with the personally desired ambience. Each participant shared a study ambience that suited them well. For example, some people like studying with a person who studies hard (P1, P3, and P12), others like an ambience that is not too quiet (P4 and P10), and others like places where there are not too many people (P3 and P6). However, in some cases, it is costly to create such an external ambience that suits each person. For example, P1 felt that it takes much social capital to find a proper person to study with who is highly motivated. P1 said,
“I have to establish a relationship to know the concentration, study habits, and kind of study of the person I’m studying with, but I don’t want to waste my energy on it.” There are cases in which not only social costs but also financial costs are incurred, for example, those who want to sit in the seat they want at the time they want (P12), and those who want an open place but quiet space (P7), pay money for the seats in the study cafe and study room.

### Why People Watch SWM Videos
Aforementioned challenges motivated participants to watch SWM videos. We found five main themes that arose when participants described why they watched SWM videos: (1) to get motivated by a creator studying in video, (2) to gain the sense of studying together, (3) to control their studying ambience easily, (4) to reduce the cost of creating a study-friendly ambience, and (5) to mitigate distraction from smartphone. In the following subsections, we describe each theme and how they affect the internal states to help them create a satisfactory studying environment.
